//! UI customization hook for stripping Win32 visual themes.
//!
//! Installs a thread-local `WH_CALLWNDPROC` hook that intercepts `WM_CREATE`
//! for every window and control created on this thread. Three customizations
//! are applied at creation time:
//!
//! 1. **DWM transition animations disabled** — removes the fade-in effect
//!    when windows are shown, which can look jarring in a utility application.
//! 2. **Visual theme removed** — [`SetWindowTheme`] with empty strings opts the
//!    window out of the current visual style, giving controls a classic flat look.
//! 3. **Theme app properties cleared** — [`SetThemeAppProperties`] with flags `0`
//!    prevents any themed painting from occurring on this thread.
//!
//! The hook must be installed before any window is created so it can intercept
//! their `WM_CREATE` messages.
